## SetUp for Development

```
  fork the github repository and run the following commands in a new directory on your PC
 
 
  git init .
  git clone https://github.com/himanish-star/Bumba-The-Assistant-App
  cd Bumba-The-Assistant-App
  npm install
  node server.js

```

The site would be available at http://localhost:3000

Incase you wish to deploy a local mongoDB server, make a mongo_working directory in the root folder, change the path for mongoDBURI in mongo/models.js to suit your own collection and run the following command

```
 mongod --dbpath=./mongo_working
```
now run 
```
 node server.js
```

The site would be available at http://localhost:3000
